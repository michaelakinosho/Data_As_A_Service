# Data_As_A_Service
Website to submit your dataset and have a regression or machine learning model created and displayed with visualizations and metrics.

It is intended to be a data as a service site.

     * Create an account if not – proceed to Profile page
  * Return to Log In to proceed
  * Land on the dashboard page
  * Submit a dataset for modelling – Submission page
  * Receive confirmation on submitted dataset – Confirmation page
  * Review prior submission, read comments provided by other users and respond to comments – Visuals page

## Nice to have
  * Would like to incorporate a messages feature so a user knows when others have commented on their submission
  * Upload profile picture, upload dataset file
  * Provide notification via text message or email when modeling is done
  * Give users the option to create account via social media accounts e.g. Apple, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn
  * Would like to implement responsive screen and mobile (Android and iOS) version if possible.
